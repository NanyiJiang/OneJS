> ~Note that this branch (onejs-v2) is a work in progress and not yet ready for use. The core foundation is more or less all set. We need to spend more time to bring it to parity with OneJS V1. If you are going to play with this branch right now, please do it in a brand new Unity project. Do not use it in your existing OneJS V1 projects yet.~

> `onejs-v2` has reached feature parity with V1. Preact, Tailwind, Styled, Emotion all work with V2 now. We are working on the documentation and demos now. Please stay tuned.

OneJS V2 is a major upgrade, transitioning from Jint to Puerts (V8). This change brings significant performance improvements, chief among them being zero-allocation ðŸ˜±ðŸ¤¯ðŸŽ‰ interop between JS and Unity (as can be seen from the demo below). 

https://github.com/DragonGround/ScriptLib/assets/666527/e2f13f44-0370-4c90-8df7-ce9078dd04f1

```tsx
import { emo } from "onejs-core/styled"
import { Color, Vector2 } from "UnityEngine"
import { MeshGenerationContext } from "UnityEngine/UIElements"

var div = document.createElement("div")
div.classname = emo`width: 100%; height: 100%;`

const NUM_BARS = 1000
const BAR_LINE_WIDTH = 1
div.ve.generateVisualContent = (ctx: MeshGenerationContext) => {
    const { width, height } = ctx.visualElement.contentRect;
    const barWidth = width / NUM_BARS;
    const halfBarWidth = barWidth / 2;
    const painter = ctx.painter2D;

    painter.lineWidth = BAR_LINE_WIDTH;
    for (let i = 0; i < NUM_BARS; i++) {
        const x = barWidth * i + halfBarWidth;
        painter.strokeColor = Color.HSVToRGB(i / NUM_BARS, 1, 1);
        painter.BeginPath();
        painter.MoveTo(new Vector2(x, height));
        painter.LineTo(new Vector2(x, height * Math.random()));
        painter.Stroke();
    }
}

document.body.appendChild(div)
setInterval(() => { div.ve.MarkDirtyRepaint() })
```

Use Menu `Tools / PuerTS / Generate (all in one)` to generate TS Typings. To optimize GC for value types, enable unsafe code and use a config class like this:

```csharp
using System;
using System.Collections.Generic;
using Puerts;
using UnityEngine;

[Configure]
public class ExamplesCfg {
    [BlittableCopy]
    static IEnumerable<Type> Blittables {
        get {
            return new List<Type>() {
                typeof(UnityEngine.Rect),
                typeof(UnityEngine.Color),
                typeof(UnityEngine.Color32),
                typeof(UnityEngine.Vector2),
                typeof(UnityEngine.Vector3),
                typeof(UnityEngine.Quaternion),
            };
        }
    }
}
```

_(More doc on this coming soon.)_

> TODO need to cover many of the other new features and improvements in V2, such as the new esbuild workflow, automatic ts typings, onejs npm modules etc.
