See the Documentation.pdf file for full documentation. Everything is also 
available at onejs.com

=============
Requirements:
=============

 - Unity.Mathematics
 - Unity Version 2021.3 (for stable UI Toolkit)
 - Unity Version 2022.1 (if you need to use UI Toolkit's Vector API)

=============
Quick Start:
=============

1) Drag ScriptEngine prefab onto a scene (it's fine to completely unpack
   the prefab)
2) Hit Play, and you should see "OneJS is good to go" in the console.

See the Sample scene and the corresponding Addons/Sample folder (under 
your project's persistentDataPath) for some references. Note the sample 
uses UI Toolkit's Vector API which requires Unity Version 2022.1

=============
More Info:
=============

OneJS's working directory is your project's persistentDataPath. All the 
scripts you write should go in there. The first time you start a game with
ScriptEngine, it will setup some default files and folders:  

|-  persistentDataPath
    |-  .vscode/
    |-  Addons/
    |-  ScriptLib/
    |-  index.js
    |-  tsconfig.json

You can put your own scripts anywhere other than the scriptLib/ folder. But 
we recommend you put them under Addons. Typescript (.ts and .tsx) is the 
recommanded language to use with OneJS. To have VSCode continuously transpile 
TS to JS in watch mode, use `Ctrl + Shift + B` or `Cmd + Shift + B` and choose 
`tsc: watch - tsconfig.json`.
