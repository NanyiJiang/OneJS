OneJS lets you tap into the full JavaScript ecosystem right inside Unity, so you can build fast, modern UIs with live reload and no browser bloat.

It's free and open-source, but if you're into it and want to support development, consider grabbing the package on the Unity Asset Store. You'll also get lifetime access to our upcoming [Game-Ready UI Library](https://onejs.com/game-uis).

<br />

## ✨ Features

* 🧬 **Native UI, no webviews** – bridges straight to UI Toolkit for true in-game performance.
* ⚡ **Instant iteration** – hit *Save*, see Unity refresh without domain reloads.
* 🛠️ **Web dev tooling** – TypeScript, JSX/Preact, Tailwind, ESBuild all pre-wired.
* 📱 **Cross-platform** – tested on desktop and mobile targets out of the box.
* 🧠 **Scriptable** – expose C# safely to JavaScript for mods or rapid prototyping.

## 🚀 Quick Start

### Install

You can use any **one** of the following three methods:

* Download and import from Asset Store.
* Unity **Package Manager → Add package by Git URL** `https://github.com/Singtaa/OneJS.git`
* Clone the repo anywhere on your machine, and use `Install package from disk` from Package Manager.

### Add the prefab

Drag the **`ScriptEngine`** prefab into an empty scene and press **Play ▶️**. OneJS will scaffold an `App/` working directory.

### Boot the toolchain

* Open `{ProjectDir}/App` with VSCode.
* Run `npm run setup` in VSCode's terminal.
* Use `Ctrl + Shift + B` or `Cmd + Shift + B` to start up all 3 watch tasks: `esbuild`, `tailwind`, and `tsc`.

### Code something

Edit `index.tsx`, hit *Save*, watch Unity live-reload 🔄.
